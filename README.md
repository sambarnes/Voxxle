# Voxxle

This is a quick puzzle game I made as a first ARKit project outside of Unity. The objective is to fit a set of block pieces into all the empty spaces of a given level. I implemented some simple mechanics for picking-up/putting-down/moving/rotating objects with 6 degrees of freedom (rather than constraining objects to a single plane). It's designed for objects that snap to a grid, but can easily be adapted to continuous positioning.
